# Project Description
---

This project was a quick crash course on React Native. I learned from the following Udemy Course [Spencer Carli's Udemy Course on React Native](https://www.udemy.com/course/create-your-first-react-native-app/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING).

I managed to get through this course in less than a day. Here is my certificate of completion.
